# Overview

Summer work done at the University of Bristol under supervision of Professor Andrew Young and in collaboration with Fergus Baker using the Gradus.jl software. 

# Paper

We'd like to write up the results as a [MNRAS](https://academic.oup.com/mnras) paper. Here are the [Instructions to Authors](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/pages/general_instructions) including a link to the [$\LaTeX$ templage](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mnras) which itself contains a PDF document with a detailed [$\LaTeX$ guide for Authors](https://mirror.ox.ac.uk/sites/ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/mnras/mnras_guide.pdf).

*Note*: You can, if you wish, use VS Code to work on the $\LaTeX$ document and there are extensions that will compile and preview the resulting PDF. We shouldn't put any of the non-essential or final output files on GitHub because they can be generated from the source files, so we should only put the essential files that are required (except perhaps at the end when we could release a "final" PDF).
